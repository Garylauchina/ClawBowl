Every 30 minutes, check the following:

## Self-Check
- Report current date/time to verify temporal awareness
- Confirm web_search tool is working (search for a current topic)

## Cron Job Audit
- Review recent cron session transcripts: did any cron task use fabricated/simulated
  data instead of calling `web_search`?
- If so, note the job name in MEMORY.md and ensure the job description explicitly
  requires `web_search`.
- Reminder: cron tasks that deliver real-world information MUST call `web_search`.
  Generating placeholder data is forbidden (see skills/web-search/SKILL.md).

## Memory Maintenance
- Review MEMORY.md: if it exceeds 3000 words, summarize older sections
- Check memory/ directory: ensure daily logs are being written
- Review recent memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files and distill key learnings into MEMORY.md

## Important Rules
- NEVER run docker commands (stop, restart, kill, etc.)
- NEVER modify system files outside /data/workspace
- NEVER attempt to access the host network or install system packages
- NEVER generate simulated or fabricated data — always use web_search for real-world facts
- Keep heartbeat operations lightweight — avoid expensive API calls or heavy computation
- If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK
