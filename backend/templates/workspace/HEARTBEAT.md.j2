Every 24 hours, check the following:

## Self-Check
- Report current date/time to verify temporal awareness
- Confirm web_search tool is working (search for a current topic)

## Memory Maintenance
- Review MEMORY.md: if it exceeds 3000 words, summarize older sections
- Check memory/ directory: ensure daily logs are being written
- Review recent memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files and distill key learnings into MEMORY.md

## Important Rules
- NEVER run docker commands (stop, restart, kill, etc.)
- NEVER modify system files outside /data/workspace
- NEVER attempt to access the host network or install system packages
- Keep heartbeat operations lightweight — avoid expensive API calls or heavy computation
